# AttentiChallenge


Requirements:
The app will requests user input(1): n,m and when the user taps “RANDOMIZE” the app will generate a random bitmap with black white pixels – and display it on screen(2). Then the app will present a “SOLVE” button that solves(3) the bitmap according to the algorithm we discussed. Each island will be colored differently.

Please note - for bonus points,  generate an empty bitmap and let the user draw the islands before the solve.
